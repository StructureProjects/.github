## About Us

We are excited to introduce our UI Library and supporting tools designed to accelerate the development of progressive web applications. Our mission is to empower developers and designers to build efficient and effective applications with ease and speed.

## Our Projects

### Structure UI
**Structure UI** is a jsx/typescript library crafted specifically for progressive web applications. This library provides a comprehensive set of standard components that streamline the app-building process. Key features include:
- **Ease of Use**: Simplify your development workflow with ready-to-use components.
- **Design-Time Support**: Perfect for designers, enabling them to create and adjust UI components effortlessly.
- **Efficiency**: Speed up the app-building process without compromising on quality or performance.

### Structure UI Gallery
**Structure UI Gallery** is an application that showcases all the controls available in Structure UI. It's your go-to resource for exploring and understanding the capabilities of our UI components. Whether you're a developer or a designer, the gallery provides a visual reference to help you choose the right components for your project.

### Structure CD (Content Designer)
**Structure CD** is our upcoming tool designed to bridge the gap between development and design. This content designer enables both developers and designers to quickly assemble app UIs, fostering a more collaborative and efficient workflow.
